# Product-and-Sales-Data
Power BI was used to create a relationship and visualize two data (Product and Sales Data)
# Data Collection
This data was given to me to practice with by Dahel Techies. 
# Data Cleaning and Preparation
* The two data loaded into Power BI was an Excel file (Product and Sales Data)
* Data was cleaned using Power Query Editor
* The top three blank rows were removed
* Headers were promoted
* Data type was changed from text to fixed decimal number 
* A new column for revenue was created (this was calculated by multiplying quantity with price).
* A model and one(product data)-to-many(sales data) relationship was created.
# Key questions to answer
  1. What is the total revenue generated
  2. What is the average ticketing price?
  3. What is the total number of orders?
  4. What is the sales performance across different channels?
  5. What is the sales performance over a specific time?

A new measure was created for the sum of revenue and average ticket price (ATP)
# Data Interpretation
* The total revenue generated between the year 2019 to 2021 was £17.91 million with an order of about 52,561 and an average ticket price of £340.7
* We can observe that people purchased food more compared to drink. 
* The pie chart shows retail is the common sales channel because it has the highest revenue.
* The lowest revenue was made during the 1st quarter (February)of 2020 and it kept decreasing till the 2nd quarter (June) of 2020, it could be a result of the COVID lockdown that happened around March/April 2020. The revenue began to increase after July and the highest revenue was made in the 4th (October) quarter of 2020. Lockdown ended around August of 2020 which can explain the reason why the revenue started to increase again. Then, there was also a decline from November 2020 until February 2021. This can be due to the fact that people lost their businesses and jobs as a result of COVID-19
* Wheat flour is the product with the highest revenue generated followed by Oil.
# Recommendations
* From the analysis that was done, Wheat flour and oil are the products that generate the highest revenue respectively. It is important to ensure that these products are also in the inventory and never out of stock. Tomato sauce and tea are the product that generates the least revenue. Awareness can be created on such products maybe it will encourage people to buy more. Also, they can be put on sale. 
* For the sales channel, products should be allocated more to the channel that generates more revenue. 
* For the sales team, some salesperson seems to be doing more than others. Motivations and maybe incentives should be given to salespersons, this might be helpful in increasing sales. Also, realistic targets should be set for them to meet.
